# What is Object Pool?
Object Pooling is an effective method for optimizing your projects and reducing the strain on the CPU caused by frequent creation and destruction of GameObjects. It's a recommended practice and design pattern to consider, as it helps to lighten the CPU load, allowing it to focus on more critical tasks instead of being overwhelmed by repetitive create and destroy operations.
